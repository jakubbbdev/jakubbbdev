## 🚀 My Developer Journey

From building Minecraft server plugins to managing production-grade Docker clusters, my path as a developer has always been driven by curiosity and passion.

I started out customizing Minecraft networks and ended up falling in love with backend development, cloud infrastructure, and performance optimization. Now I build fullstack applications, run CI/CD pipelines, manage Linux servers, and love every second of it.

My focus areas today:

* Fullstack Web Dev with TypeScript, Python & PHP
* Infrastructure, Monitoring, and Automation
* Advanced Frontends with React and animations
* Building things that actually scale 🚀
